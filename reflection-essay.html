            Choosing a future path will never be easy for teenagers with a lot of
            possibilities in mind. It’s hard enough for a 16-year old to decide on anything
            in particular, let alone their trajectory in life. Consequently, confusion
            will be normal at first as will the internal struggle. All of this is due to the
            classic fickleness of our generation, always seeking the best among a vast range
            of available professions without even taking into consideration what we really do enjoy.
            But the answer really lies in what you want and what you need because you are drawn to the
            idea of working in that field and you really do like it. There is always a certain degree
            of error, but opportunities will always present themselves.
            The idea is to work at doing what we do best and what we truly want the most.
            That’s the only way to find meaning or satisfaction in the future, through our own
            accomplishments. The path can be a difficult one, but the
            path taken and the questions that arise during this short journey are what make it so
            exciting, in that you need to make the biggest decision of your life: choosing a university
            program and following through with it.

              When you hear that anyone can learn the skills they need to become
              a developer, there’s one important caveat. If you’re going to
              learn to code, you need to be willing to work hard. Coding is an
              attainable skill, but it isn’t easy and there are challenges
              you’ll encounter along the way. We recently asked some of our
              students – who are now developers – what they found most
              challenging about learning to code. Here are 4 of the major
              challenges of learning to code that they shared.</span
            >

            <h4>Imposter Syndrome:-</h4>
            <p>
              Whether you’re new to programming or a veteran developer, you will
              be all too familiar with the lurking presence of Imposter Syndrome
              when it comes to learning to code. Lacking confidence in your
              skills is common when you’re new, but honestly, it’s unnecessary.
              Remember every expert developer was once a beginner and they know
              how it felt. The tech industry is a welcoming and supportive
              community where you can find others with more experience who are
              willing to collaborate or offer guidance (provided you put
              yourself out there to meet people in tech). As stay-at-home mom
              and front end developer, Priscilla Lunda, describes “For me, the
              greatest challenge was the fear and insecurity that held me back
              in the beginning… That fear and insecurity still creeps up at
              times and I wonder if I’m good/smart enough to be successful in
              this field. But then I remember that I love coding and every day
              is an opportunity to continue to learn.”
            </p>

            <h4>Trying to understand it all:-</h4>
            <p>
              Learning to code is like learning any new language. At first,
              ideas and concepts of coding can feel abstract. Then, even once
              you’ve begun to grasp the basics, you’ll need to start piecing
              those bit of knowledge into understanding. As Treehouse moderator
              and developer, Jennifer Nordell, describes, “There will likely
              come a time in your learning when you notice things becoming
              significantly more difficult. These tend to happen when concepts
              come into play. You’ve learned the basic building blocks, but now
              you must put them together to architect a solution to a problem.
              In my experience, this feels a bit like standing at the bottom of
              a cliff. It is here that I’ve felt the most frustration in my
              learning process.”
            </p>

            <h4>Finding the time:-</h4>
            <p>
              Another common challenge that you’ll face when learning to code is
              finding the time, especially when you have to factor it in between
              work, life, and family. As developer, Jeffrey McKim, describes,
              “we’re in hard times. Rent is high, wages are low, social mobility
              is stagnating. There are a million distractions and a million
              reasons to quit.” This is when self-disciplined comes in. Set
              yourself learning goals and establish a schedule. Here are a few
              tips on how to fit learning to code into your 9-5. There will
              likely be plenty of times when you don’t feel like sitting down at
              your computer to learn during the weekend or after a long day at
              work. Those days, remind yourself of the end goal and what you can
              achieve if you persevere. For example, when you’re lacking
              motivation after a bad day in the office and struggling to find
              the motivation to learn, remember that once you master those
              in-demand coding skills, you can leave that job behind.
            </p>

            <h4>The frustration:-</h4>
            <p>
              The final challenge is one that anyone who has touched code can
              relate to; periods of extreme frustration. Whether it’s a hidden
              error in your code, a new concept you’re trying to learn, or
              another issue you’ve encountered, the frustration can be
              overwhelming. When that happens, you may feel like you want to
              quit. As Jeffrey describes it, “I thought about quitting. I threw
              things and once even kicked a hole through my wall. I cried. I
              started at the same lines of code for hours before I realized I
              was missing a semicolon, or forgot to close a div. I can’t count
              how many times I did that.” In reality, you’ll have to confront
              these frustrations through your career as a developer, BUT
              everytime you persevere, debug, and problem-solve, you’ll learn
              something new which can help you to avoid similar frustrations in
              the future.
