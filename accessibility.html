            When we say accessibility in the context of web technology, most
            people immediately think of making sure websites/apps are usable by
            people with disabilities, for example:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Visually impaired people using screen readers or
              magnification/zoom to access text
            </li>
            <li>
              People with motor function impairments using the keyboard (or
              other non-mouse features) to activate website functionality.
            </li>
            <li>
              People with hearing impairments relying on captions/subtitles or
              other text alternatives for audio/video content.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            However, it is wrong to say that accessibility is just about
            disabilities. Really, the aim of accessibility is to make your
            websites/apps usable by as many people in as many contexts as
            possible, not just those users using high-powered desktop computers.

          <h4>How the group tested the code for accessibility through automated tests?</h4>
          <p>
            We used several automated tests and tools to ensure that our pages fulfill the guidelines
            for what an accessible page is. We used the web accessibility evaluation tool list on w3.org
            to check, and from there picked different tools to evaluate our pages.
            First, we used the A-Tester by Evaluera Ltd. It checks the pre-enhanced version of
            the web pages against it’s standard, and thus determines if the website is accessible
            for people with disabilities. We got a hundred percent health score. We used another
            accessibility test; this time at https://www.accessi.org, and we were very satisfied
            with the result. Lastly, we used the color contrast test at https://color.a11y.com
            to check how accessible our site was in terms of the color contrasts.
            Our choice of colors had some problems, but overall, they weren’t very problematic
            as we will explain below, so we still went ahead with our choice of colors for the pages.

          <h4>
            checking, validating, and coding-choices for universal design beyond
            what an automated test can do?
          </h4>
          <p>
            We brainstormed for some time and decided on some ways to test our code without the
            automatic tests. We initially planned on doing this earlier on, but we later decided
            to first create a rough sketch (mockup) of the site, then make a layout for the code.
            After this was done, and the initial version of the website was up, we tested it
            by turning off our mouse and interact with it using our keyboard only.
            This was done because many users are unable to interact with the web with a mouse
            and rely purely on the keyboard. However, when testing our website, we realized
            that this worked poorly at the start because using the tab key, we couldn’t navigate
            through the menu bar at the top of the site. To solve this problem, we decided to
            code a second “menu-like bar” at the bottom at the website. We made it stylish,
            so it did not look out of place, and we also added a hovering effect
            if interacted with by a mouse.
          </p>
          In our second test, we decided to turn off the images and see if the website still made
          sense for the users. Images are important, but the website should still be readable and
          understandable for the users, if they for some reason (low bandwidth etc.) are unable
          to see the images. We realized that we had used a lot of images as titles and headings.
          When we turned off the images, nothing really made sense, because the headings were gone.
          To combat this, we made the headings text based. We used the images as hero images to
          describe the content of our pages in a visual way. The images enhanced the site,
          but now the content was not essentially reliant upon the images.

          <p>
            Lastly, we tested the color contrast on our page, by having a few color-blind friends
            test it out. Everyone reported that the color contrast was comfortable to their eyes,
            and that everything was clear to read and understand. Therefore, we still went with
            our colors of choice, even though the automated color test didn’t give us a full score.
