            Technology affects the way individuals communicate, learn, and think. It helps society
            and determines how people interact with each other on a daily basis. Technology plays
            an important role in society today. It has positive and negative effects on the world
            and it impacts daily lives. We are living in an era where technological advances are common.
            The internet and cell phones are some examples. However, with technological advances,
            there’s a downside to it all.

          <h4>The interplay between technology and society</h4>
          <p>
            One of the basic consequences of the internet is that it connects the world;
            the rich with the poor, the oppressor with the oppressed, and the citizen with the
            president; among other. This connection makes the global spread of different ideologies
            easier, and politics are based on ideologies. Perhaps the most important and
            helping function the internet provides when it comes to the business side of
            things, is the transfer of money in form of business transactions from one country
            to another; this can conflict with the differences in the laws in different countries.
            What might be illegal in one country might be completely legal in another country.
            There are multiple political factors to consider when doing a business in one country,
            but when business is done through the borders, through a virtual gate (the internet),
            it can become increasingly difficult and challenging for the government to regulate it
            so that it complies with the law. One such example is the popular platform called Fiverr
            ; it allows people to sell their services and products.
            Most countries in the developing world have not update their laws as fast as the internet
            has changed, and some specialists in these countries have taken advantage of this to sell
            services that would be deemed unethical and/or illegal for people in the west. For example,
            some people sell Facebook page likes and fake Instagram and Twitter followers.
            As the internet develop, practices change, and knowledge is transferred, the government
            will have to change their laws and understanding as well.

          <h4>Digital cities and the welfare state</h4>
          <p>
            As a group, we agree to a lot of what Hanne Cecilie Geirbo says in the video about electrical
            scooters we believe the electric scooter can be a big deal in the future and change the way
            of transport used by citizens.
            We think that the practicality of having an electrical scooter is key, especially in countries
            where the temperature is warm or bearable for riders all year. Electric scooter companies
            could provide a lot of jobs in our society and create a better infrastructure to expand
            the business and make it more profitable. A lot of good things could be done with the design
            so that a lot more people could qualify to use these scooters. The scooters need to be designed
            with a few more safety features and a comfortable seat that the riders can use. If the design
            gets better, we can see the scooter being one of the main ways of transport specially in urban areas.
            There is a lot of traffic nowadays in urban areas and a lot of vehicles that pollute the environment.
            The focus on global warming in the media will probably continue to be a hot topic and this can be
            a perfect solution besides electric cars to avoid pollution. The citizens would fancy taking a
            scooter to a job nearby rather than a car if it is safe and comfortable and takes you to job inside the same time limit as your car. If the problem with safety gets solved or improved, we can see a lot of people adopting this new way of travelling around the city at the same time as they enjoy the fresh air.
            To conclude, we can say that the electrical scooter could easily be evolved and become extremely
            important in urban areas in the future.

          <h4>Technology and sustainability</h4>
          <p>
            In our opinion, the research of environment friendly technology and recycling
            is the way of balancing environmental issues. Production of technological
            devices have a bad effect on the environment, and companies shall focus more
            on making this process as efficient and environment friendly as possible.
            Researching is an important part of this process and can potentially result
            in the innovation of some type of material that is usable for the same purpose
            with less environmental impact. There should also be strict rules that tells
            the companies what is, and what isn’t allowed in the production stage.
            Every company should follow the rules and be a “greener” company.
            Those who does not follow the rules shall get fines and be penalized immediately.
            The companies will then take more care as being penalized will be bad PR for companies
            and could make some of their buyers turn their back on them. We don’t think that
            a 100% green industry is possible before a long time, but a “greener” industry is
            always a possibility and should be worked with by the companies and authorities
            around the world. Global warming is an issue that everyone must take seriously,
            and these companies are no different.

            We as a group has had a lot of phones throughout our life, and changing phones nowadays
            is a trend specially looking at Apple`s IPhone. In January 2021 Apple came out with
            a statement that said that there are over 1 billion active iPhones in the world.
            (Kastrenakes).
            Apple has been successful in making people buy their new phone every year, and this
            Is a growing trend for people that like iPhone. It seems like they make the phone so
            that it is well functioning for a year or two, and then the problems start to come into
            the picture. This Is a good way of making a lot of money, however it can be done differently.
            In our opinions, the Phone should be giving you more value when you hold it for longer.
            These companies can earn money if they give big updates to the phone like Tesla does
            with their cars. This way, the customers feel like they are getting more out of the purchase
            and the company could earn money by taking paid for exclusive functions that the customers want.
            The companies can make surveys to keep contact with the customers and their needs.
            This can make the phone more user friendly and more attractive for users because they
            are part of the designing process
